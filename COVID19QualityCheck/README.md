#Test name for Project: 
Review-based Quality Check for use of Public places post-Lockdown

#short description: 
An application that lets you determine if a place is safe to visit or not post lockdown

#Hypothesis:

#
##Statement of the problem:
As the Covid-19 spurs uncertainty into our lives, we are uncertain even as to step out of our houses once the lockdown lifts. We are skeptical as to whether the place we are deciding to visit (for example a restaurant for a meal or a hospital for regular checkup) owing to the fear of contracting a virus. There is no particular way to make sure if a place we want to visit is properly sanitized and is safe to visit or that the place is maintaining a very effective screening process for the visitors.

##Detailed description:
To deal with this problem, we are curating a Review-based application where a person visiting a restaurant or a hospital or any other public place for that matter can provide a rating for the criteria like screening process, cleanliness, following of social distancing norms, frequency of sanitization of items that the public use etc. The rating provided for each of these criteria can be used to determine a green, orange or red indicator to the place: Green meaning completely safe to visit, Orange meaning Safe to visit and Red meaning Unsafe to visit. There will also be a text box where the visitor can provide a comprehensive review as well if they want, since we don’t want the reviewer to keep the review confined to these criteria only. The indicators will be revised weekly, based on the ratings provided by the users.

##Impact of this solution:
Based on the indicator and the reviews that the users have provided, the people wanting to visit the place can get an idea of how safe that place is to visit. Another aspect to this solution is that the owners of the public place, for example the restaurant owners derive benefit from it in the sense that if their rating is low, they need to work on the sanitization and screening so that they can get a good indicator from the customers and hence do better business. 

##Goals accomplished:
1.	Ensuring that the users have a safe visit and are able to enjoy some of the aspects of their daily lives that they could before Covid-19 happened 
2.	Ensuring that the businesses can strive towards a healthier, cleaner and well-sanitized environment while also making it a priority.
3.	The businesses can determine better outputs in terms of business for themselves by effective adherence to Covid-19 guidelines so as to compensate for the losses incurred during the lockdown.

##Variation from other solutions:
Such a solution is the need of the hour and we believe there is no such solution catering to this particular problem. Whilst we have other review and feedback applications for various purposes, this application stands out because it is of massive relevance today when we are trying to restore our normal. The application’s objective is to make the users rely on the process of the reviews provided by other people, which helps them judge for themselves and take the right step and also give right reviews based on the criteria provided.

#Future Scope:
1.	We also look forward to creating a module “Restaurant of the week” or similarly for other places, based on the safety. 
2.	Can add some other criteria to calculate the formula for indicators, as and when more discoveries on Covid-19 safety norms be rolled out. 
3.	We also aim to create a scrutinizing process wherein people cannot post misleading reviews to malign the reputation of the place or to mislead the visitors, so only verified accounts shall be able to review the places.
4.	We look forward to a shift to a mobile application as well and make it more engaging and user-friendly.
5.	We can integrate the same with payment apps, so that when payments are made, an SMS or email is triggered to the user to provide the feedback.
6.	Enhance the UI of the application and make it more seamless for a better user experience.
